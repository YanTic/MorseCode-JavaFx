```
    git clone https://github.com/YanTic/MorseDesktop-JavaFx.git 
        or
    git clone --single-branch --branch gradle https://github.com/YanTic/MorseDesktop-JavaFx.git

## Features & Use âœŒ
The morse language uses dots and dashes for comunication. If you're new in the morse world, you can use the guide (or tutorial) inside the program.

Every letter has a translation to Morse.

You just have to type the dots and dashes of every letter until building the complete word
